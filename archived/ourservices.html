          <p class="style1"><strong><strong><img src="images/test-3.gif" alt="Senior Care WNY" width="315" height="183" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></strong>Are you one of the 80% of family members  who struggle with caregiving for an elderly family member?</strong><br />
              Caregiving falls primarily to women aged 46 &ndash; 55  years old who also work full time, fulfill 20 hours of parenting/spousal  responsibilities and another 18 hours of caregiving a week. It&rsquo;s exhausting just thinking about a <strong>78 hour work week!</strong> </p>
            <p class="style1"><strong>Are you frustrated by your Parent&rsquo;s  failing memory?</strong><br />
  Do you know that &frac12; of people over 85 will  develop Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease? That&rsquo;s  right! Memory issues are a huge concern  for Seniors and their families. Forty  percent of admissions to Hospitals and Nursing Homes of people over 65 years  old are the result of forgetting to take medications as prescribed. Either forgetting to take medications for  days on end or forgetting if they took their medications and taking additional  doses. With memory problems comes loss  of driving privileges.</p>
            <p class="style1"><strong>Are you concerned about your elderly  loved one falling?</strong><br />
  One out of three Seniors will experience a major  fall each year. One out of four, 25% of  Seniors who suffer a hip fracture will die within one year. A large percentage of Senior falls result in Emergency  Room visits and hospitalization.</p>
            <p class="style1"><strong>How much longer can you  shoulder the burden alone?</strong><br />
  What was once a challenge has become a burden  that you can no longer juggle. You need  help but don&rsquo;t want to abandon your elderly loved one. So where do you turn? Who understands your frustration and the  problems your faced with?&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="style1"><strong>How did you end up working an extra 18  hours a week?</strong><br />
  As your elderly loved ones got older, you  probably went over to check on their well-being, called them several times a  week and lent a hand to do a few chores or run a few errands. As time went by, other family members who  used to help moved away, their friends passed away, requiring you to do a  little more.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="style1">Your loved ones developed chronic diseases  making the household chores more difficult for them to do. They developed osteoporosis, arthritis and  other conditions of aging. And, finally  they began to fall and demonstrated some issues with their memory. As each year passed, you found yourself doing  more and more. Stress began to build but  you suppressed it because there was no else to help. Then you began to experience mixed emotions  of resentment and guilt.</p>
            <p class="style1"><strong>Good Samaritan &ndash; The Most Trusted Name in  Caring and Compassion</strong><br />
  Imagine having a Certified Companion Aide that  you trust to help your elderly loved one. Feel the stress relief from finishing your work and not needing to rush  over to Mom&rsquo;s to do her cooking or laundry. Picture your days with no more guilt over not being able to do  enough. Envision no more resentment that  you are the only one doing all the work. No more worry about their daily  well-being.</p>
            <p class="style1">There is only one way to know for sure how we  can help. To fully understand your needs  and those of Seniors is to compete an Assessment. Our goal is to help Seniors maintain their  independence and have them remain in their own home for as long as  possible. In-home care with a Companion  Aide is most often the least expensive alternative. By completing an Assessment we can develop a  highly personal, individualized Care Plan.  The Care Plan is tailored to the Senior&rsquo;s specific needs.</p>
            <p class="style1"><strong>The Path to Better Relationships</strong><br />
  Bringing in a Companion Aide to help will allow  you to return to the healthy relationship you had with your elderly loved one &ndash;  where you can visit and spend quality time with them. The Companion Aide will provide all the  assistance your loved one needs with their Activities of Daily Living &ndash;  cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping. </p>
            <p class="style1"><em>We use a host of unique ways to ensure a  safety-net is developed using exclusive technologies offered to Good Samaritan  through our membership in The Senior&rsquo;s Choice. We are one of the only companies to offer <strong>Arrival  Assurance</strong>, a web-based telephony system using telephonic  clock-in, clock-out.<strong>DirectLINK</strong> is a Personal Emergency Monitoring System providing 24/7 monitoring.</em></p>
            <p class="style1"><em>Our owners have over 50 years of healthcare  executive management experience. They  understand the complexities of the fragmented healthcare system and their only  purpose is to aid Seniors and their families to find the most cost-effective  services available. By using a combination of certified companion aides and  selective technologies we are able to develop a plan of care to suit every  need.</em></p>
            <p class="style1"><em>A Companion Aide can help Seniors maintain their  independence and dignity, while allowing them to remain safe in their own  home. By remaining in control, Seniors  have a much better quality of life.</em></p>
            <p class="style1"><em>Ask yourself, with this mind-set what would you  have to lose by contacting us to learn more?</em></p>
            <p class="style1"><strong>Good Samaritan has the expertise</strong> <br />
  Good Samaritan has been helping the &quot;Sandwich Generation&quot; reduce their  stress.&nbsp; We do this by being the trusted caregivers for working men and  women so they can focus on their careers and families, while we assist their  aging parents with the Activities of Daily Living. We like you to feel  the Peace-Of-Mind that comes with, <u>&quot;Leaving Mom and Dad in the Trusted  Hands of the Good Samaritan.&quot;</u></p>
            <p class="style1">We provide in-home,  non-medical services so seniors may remain safe in their own home while  maintaining their independence and dignity for as long as possible.&nbsp;</p>
