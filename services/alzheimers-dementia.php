            <h1>Alzheimers &amp; Dementia Care</h1>
            <p>Good Samaritan understands that approximately 5.1 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease, a condition that affects the parts of the brain that control thought, memory and language.   Caring for a Senior with Alzheimer's disease can be a challenge in many ways. Simple everyday tasks and activities become progressively more difficult.</p>
            <p>Our care is designed so  Good Samaritan's  Aides, are equipped with daily activities to help keep Seniors with Alzheimer's disease active.  Seniors with Alzheimer's disease can benefit from participation in specific activities. Their lives can be enriched because activities can help to increase their feelings of usefulness and self-worth. 
            <br />Other benefits that may result from activities provided by a Good Samaritan Aide:
            <ul>
                <li>Enhancement and maintenance of general health</li>
                <li>Enhancement and maintenance of communications skills</li>
                <li>Decreased pacing and restlessness</li>
                <li>Increased nighttime sleep</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>We use materials and resources provided by the Alzheimer's Association including Coach Broyles' Playbook for Alzheimer's Caregivers, to train our Aides to care for any Senior experiencing memory issues.</p>
            <p></p>
            <div id="accordion">
                <h3 class="med-blu">Are you one of the 80% of family members who struggle with caregiving for an elderly family member?</h3>
                <div><p>Caregiving falls primarily to women aged 46 - 55 years old who also work full time, fulfill 20 hours of parenting/spousal responsibilities and another 18 hours of caregiving a week. It's exhausting just thinking about a 78 hour work week! </p></div>
                <h3 class="med-blu">Are you frustrated by your Parent's failing memory?</h3>
                <div><p>Do you know that half of people over 85 will develop Alzheimer's Disease? That's right! Memory issues are a huge concern for Seniors and their families. Forty percent (45%) of admissions to Hospitals and Nursing Homes of people over 65 years old are the result of forgetting to take medications as prescribed. Either forgetting to take medications for days on end or forgetting if they took their medications and taking additional doses. With memory problems comes loss of driving privileges.</p></div>
                <h3 class="med-blu">Are you concerned about your elderly loved one falling?</h3>
                <div><p>One out of three Seniors will experience a major fall each year. One out of four, 25% of Seniors who suffer a hip fracture will die within one year. A large percentage of Senior falls result in Emergency Room visits and hospitalization.  The effects of Alzheimer's disease is a factor in falling.</p></div>
                <h3 class="med-blu">How much longer can you shoulder the burden alone?</h3>
                <div><p>What was once a challenge has become a burden that you can no longer juggle.  You need help but don't want to abandon your elderly loved one. So where do you turn? Who understands your frustration and the problems your faced with?</p></div>
                <h3 class="med-blu">How did you end up working an extra 18 hours a week?</h3>
                <div><p>As your elderly loved ones got older, you probably went over to check on their well-being, called them several times a week and lent a hand to do a few chores or run a few errands. As time went by, other family members who used to help moved away, their friends passed away, requiring you to do a little more.<br /><br />Your loved ones developed chronic diseases making the household chores more difficult for them to do. They developed osteoporosis, arthritis and other conditions of aging. And, finally they began to fall and demonstrated some issues with their memory. As each year passed, you found yourself doing more and more. Stress began to build but you suppressed it because there was no else to help. Then you began to experience mixed emotions of resentment and guilt.</p></div>
                <h3 class="med-blu">Good Samaritan - The Most Trusted Name in Caring and Compassion</h3>
                <div><p>Imagine having an Aide that you trust to help your elderly loved one. Feel the stress relief from finishing your work and not needing to rush over to Mom's to do her cooking or laundry. Picture your days with no more guilt over not being able to do enough. Envision no more resentment that you are the only one doing all the work. No more worry about their daily well-being.<br /><br />There is only one way to know for sure how we can help. To fully understand your needs and those of Seniors is to compete an Assessment. Our goal is to help Seniors maintain their independence and have them remain in their own home for as long as possible. In-home care with a Companion Aide is most often the least expensive alternative. By completing an Assessment we can develop a highly personal, individualized Care Plan. The Care Plan is tailored to the Senior's specific needs.</p></div>
                <h3 class="med-blu">The Path to Better Relationships</h3>
                <div><p>Bringing in an Aide to help will allow you to return to the healthy relationship you had with your elderly loved one - where you can visit and spend quality time with them. The Aide will provide all the assistance your loved one needs with their Activities of Daily Living - cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping. <br /><br />We use a host of unique ways to ensure a safety-net is developed using exclusive technologies offered to Good Samaritan through our membership in The Senior's Choice. We are one of the only companies to offer Arrival Assurance, a web-based telephony system using telephonic clock-in, clock-out.DirectLINK is a Personal Emergency Monitoring System providing 24/7 monitoring.<br /><br />Our administrators have over 50 years of healthcare executive management experience. They understand the complexities of the fragmented healthcare system and their only purpose is to aid Seniors and their families to find the most cost-effective services available. By using a combination of certified companion aides and selective technologies we are able to develop a plan of care to suit every need.<br /><br />An Aide can help Seniors maintain their independence and dignity, while allowing them to remain safe in their own home. By remaining in control, Seniors have a much better quality of life.<br /><br />Ask yourself, with this mind-set what would you have to lose by contacting us to learn more?</p></div>
                <h3 class="med-blu">Good Samaritan has the expertise </h3>
