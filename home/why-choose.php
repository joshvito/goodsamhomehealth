            <h1>Why Choose Good Samaritan</h1>
            <p><h4 class="med-blu">Knowledge, Experience and Commitment</h4>
                Our leaders have advanced degrees in healthcare, over 50 years of combined healthcare management experience and an unsurpassed commitment to the elderly.

            <p><h4 class="med-blu">Our Caregivers - Selection, Hiring, Orientation and Training</h4>
                Our Aide's quality starts with the selection process. Not everyone meets the qualities we seek in our Caregivers - Caring &amp; Compassion. Following extensive background checks, including references, criminal and DMV checks, only those selected are invited to our Orientation. The screening of Personal Care Aides and Home Health Aides includes accessing the NYS Department of Health Nurse Registry and Health Commerce System. <br><br>In Orientation our Aides learn our unique approach to assisting our patients.<!--  Our proprietary Certified Companion Aide (CCA&reg;) Program is nationally recognized certification program offered to our professional staff of Companion Aides. Each Good Samaritan Companion Aide is trained and tested in 19 subject areas, ranging from transferring to dementia. -->
